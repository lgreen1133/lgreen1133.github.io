title: Maintaining Portfolio
---

It's been quite a while since I posted an update. Came to take a peek and realized the header wasn't loading on my portfolio. I realized there were a couple things out of date, so ended up tweaking a few things:

* Updated to Jekyll 3.0
* Included pagination gem in config file
* Changed `theme` to `theme_settings` across the project
* Updated site url from GitHub pages to custom domain
* Updated gravatar for fun

Everything seems to be running ok...for now.
